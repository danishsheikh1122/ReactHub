            1/ The NextJS starter with all the boilerplate code you need to run
            an online business: a payment system, a database, login, a blog, UI
            components, and much more.
            <br />
            The repo is available in:
            <br />- Javascript and Typescript
            <br />- /app router and /pages router.
          </p>
          <p>
            2/ The documentation helps you set up your app from scratch, write
            copy that sells, and ship fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            3/ Access to our Discord with makers who build fast to stay
            accountable!

      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed text-[#CFCFCF]">
          <p>Yes, as long as you're comfortable with React & NextJS.</p>
          <p>
            Libraries are independent. You can use SendGrid instead of Mailgun,
            LemonSqueezy instead of Stripe, or Postgres instead of MongoDB, for
            instance.

      question: "Is it a website template?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed text-[#CFCFCF]">
          <p>
            It's more than just a template. You can copy/paste sections to build
            your site quickly, like a pricing section, an FAQ, and even an
            entire blog. You also get a bunch of UI components like buttons,
            modals, popovers, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NextJS starter also comes with handy tools you need to run an
            online businessâ€”payment processing, emails, SEO, etc.

      question: "How is ShipFast better than other boilerplates?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed text-[#CFCFCF]">
          <p>
            It's packed with everything you need to run an online business. It
            also helps you get started quickly with copywriting tips, tips to
            ship fast, and a Discord community of makers.
          </p>
          <p>Plus, it comes with the documentation you need to get started.</p>

      question: "Is it open source?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed text-[#CFCFCF]">
          <p>No, it's a paid product.</p>
          <p>
            You can use the code as long as you want for your own projects. But
            you cannot create your own SaaS boilerplate starter based on
            ShipFast.
